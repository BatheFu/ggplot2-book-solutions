## ggplot2-book-solutions

This is a collection of solutions to selected exercises from 
[Hadley Wickhams](http://hadley.nz/) 
[ggplot2-book](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) (as of December 2015). 
Of course, there is no guarantee that my solutions are correct nor do they always 
present the most efficient way of doing things.

Please fell free to comment or correct anything that you think is wrong or 
somehow noteworthy (by writing an issue or by sending a pull request).
