## ggplot2-book-solutions

This is an collection of solutions to selected exercises from [Hadley Wickhams](https://github.com/hadley) [ggplot2-book](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) (as of December 2015). Of course, there is no guarantee that my solutions are correct nor do they always present the most efficient way of doing things.

Please fell free to comment or correct anything that you think is wrong or somehow noteworthy (by writing an issue or by sending a pull request).
