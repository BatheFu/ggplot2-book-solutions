## ggplot2-book-solutions

This is an collection of solutions to selected exercises from [Hadley Wickhams](https://github.com/hadley) [ggplot2-book](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) (as of December 2015). Of course, there is no guarantee that my solutions are correct nor do they always present the most efficient way of doing things.
